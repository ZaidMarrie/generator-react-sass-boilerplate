# React + Sass Boilerplate

A Yeoman generator that creates a minimal Gulp and Sass front-end workflow.

Based off of Nando Moreirame's Gulp generator 🙏🏼

## Instructions

Install Yeoman globally: `npm install -g yo`

Then install the Gulp + Sass boilerplate generator globally: `npm install -g generator-react-sass-boilerplate`

Navigate to a directory you want to generate the files in, then run `yo react-sass-boilerplate`

Then in the project root, run the website by running `npm run dev`.
